# Why?
1. Fix crash with double push of view controller to navigation stack (reproduced even in Settings app).
2. Notifications to simplify implementation of custom tab bar controller.

# How?

Just add pod to your project. No imports needed (imports needed only if you want to use notifications).

# Requirements
> iOS 7.1
